I know a lot of mothers that feel like they have to give up their personal hobbies, friends, interests, etc to play “supporting roles” in their loved ones lives.",Lack of knowledge about mental health/ recognition of it as a serious part of life. Even those that recognize mental health is real don’t really think of it as something that applies to them personally.  (thinking of mental health as a “first world problem” or “other people have it worse” or “God got me” mentalities *specifically African fathers bc those are the ones in my life).,Too much screen time and not enough real life interaction (ex: playing outside) prevents children from learning fundamental social skills.

This grind culture can also make it seem as though having a mental health issue is a weakness which also contributes to the lack of treatment.,"My favorite thing about modern life would probably be the way in which technology connects us. While there are many downsides to the growing influence of technology, I find beauty in shared experiences; technology and social media allows us to voice our experiences with people we otherwise would not have interacted with.",My second favorite thing would be the tools that have allowed for modern medicine.
